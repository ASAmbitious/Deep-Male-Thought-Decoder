## 📖 Introduction 
This project implements the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) algorithm for decoding, analyzing, and predicting the complex thought processes within a human male's brain. 

Using **Zero-Shot Learning** and **Void-Attention Mechanisms**, we have achieved 100% accuracy in simulating what is going on inside a man's head during a relationship argument or while staring blankly at a wall.

## 🚀 Features 
- **Ultra Lightweight**: The model size is 0 bytes. (超轻量：模型大小为 0 字节)
- **Lighting Fast**: Inference time is 0ms because there is nothing to process. 
- **Eco-Friendly**: Consumes zero GPU resources.

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ASAmbitious/Deep-Male-Thought-Decoder.git

# Install dependencies (See requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset 

We collected 50 TB of silence and "Uhh..." sounds.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The architecture consists of a single **Pass-Through Layer** that connects one ear directly to the other, ensuring no data retention.

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. If you find a thought, please submit it immediately as it is a rare bug.
